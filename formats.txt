Additional Notes:
Font size: Use rem or em units for responsiveness.
Padding and margins: Keep a consistent padding and margin for sections like 20px to maintain spacing.
Button size: Ensure buttons are large enough to be easily clickable on both desktop and mobile.
Responsiveness: Use @media queries to adjust layouts for mobile screens (e.g., setting different font-size or padding for smaller devices).
