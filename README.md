## Introduction
The **Online Stationery Inventory Management System** addresses the inefficiencies of manual stationery ordering and stock management at **Cobie Books & Stationers**. By shifting to an online platform, the system reduces errors, improves record-keeping, and provides real-time visibility into product availability. Customers can place orders, and admins can efficiently manage stock levels.

The system is based on the **Rapid Application Development (RAD)** model, focusing on fast prototyping and iterative development to meet business needs.

## Features
- **Customer Features**:
  - User registration and login.
  - Browse available stationery products.
  - Add products to the cart and place orders.
  - View and track order history.
  - Payment on delivery or through integrated online gateways.
  
- **Admin Features**:
  - Manage users (add, update, delete).
  - Add, update, or remove products from the inventory.
  - View and manage orders placed by customers.
  - Generate reports on sales and inventory levels.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python 3, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (with optional jQuery for UI enhancements)
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Active Directory Naming Services (ADNS)
- **Development Tools**: Sublime Text, Adobe Photoshop (for design assets)
- **Database**: SQLite (or MySQL for production)
- **Platform Requirements**:
  - Operating System: Windows 7 or above
  - Web Browser: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox
  - Minimum Hardware: 1.6GHz Processor, 4GB RAM, 500GB Hard Disk

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stationery-inventory-management.git
    cd stationery-inventory-management
    ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the database**:
